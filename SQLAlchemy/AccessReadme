ADDING A CHARACTER TO THE DATABASE:
Once you have a character:
from clientCharacter import ClientCharacter
from clientCharacter import ClientDataAccess
Leon = ClientCharacter()
CDA = ClientDataAccess()
CDA.addClientCharacter(Leon)

GETTING A LIST OF CHARACTERS:
from databaseCreation import Character
from dataAccess import DataAccess
DA = DataAccess()
DA.getCharacters(username) # this gives a list of Character objects (NOT ClientCharacter) -- these do not have attacks, abilites, or weaknesses in them

GETTING A SPECIFIC CHARACTER:
from clientCharacter import ClientCharacter
from clientCharacter import ClientDataAccess
CDA = ClientDataAccess()
cchar = CDA.getClientCharacter(char.id) # get the char.id from the list of characters -- This returns a Client Character with ALL character data formatted exactly the submission to add it
