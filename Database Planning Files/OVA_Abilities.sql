For every Level you have in Armored, you may reduce the Damage Multiplier of any incoming attack by 1. If the Damage Multiplier would be reduced to zero or below, reduce it to 1/2 instead. [In situations where the Level in Armored far exceeds the Damage Multiplier, the Game Master may choose to nullify the attack outright.

VALUES ("Attack", 
"Sometimes, you have no choice but to fight. Luckily, you are equipped to deal with that! Your Attack Ability represents your capacity to dish out damage to adversaries, and each Level will increase your Damage Multiplier by 1. Whether Attack represents an ancient martial arts technique, a really big sword, or simply your fists is completely up to you. And if you like, it can remain as simple as that. However, Players hankering for a more detailed representation of their combat prowess can choose to create a suite of attacks. Each of these possesses the same bonus to your Damage Multiplier, but you may modify them with a variety of Ability Perks and Flaws. Located at the end of this chapter, Perks grant your attacks special abilities that they ordinarily would not have, like improved accuracy or the ability to pierce tough armor. However, these benefits come at the cost of an Endurance expenditure. Next to each Perk is a number, and this represents the additional Endurance cost of your attack. To counteract this, you may take Flaws. These will reduce the Endurance cost but also apply special hindrances to your attack. You can take any combination of Perks and Flaws, but the Endurance cost for any attack may never be reduced below zero. [Creating a suite of attacks may seem daunting at first. Check out the various Sample Characters to get a feel for what can be done, or simply leave your Attack Ability as a flat bonus. You can always describe what makes your attacks unique on the fly.]"

VALUES ("Barrier", 
"You have the ability to protect yourself with a barrier of some kind. This could be a magical shield, an electronic device, or anything else that can protect you from harm. Instead of making a normal Defense roll in combat, you may roll your Barrier dice instead. In addition, if your opponent’s attack still connects, you may burn Endurance to “buy off” Damage on a onefor-one basis. With enough Endurance, you can theoretically nullify any attack! Using barriers this way, brought up in a flash in the heat of battle, can certainly be effective, but when used preemptively, they are even more valuable. If you decide to maintain a barrier, you may roll double your Barrier dice. This preparedness comes at a cost, however, as you may not perform any other actions while doing so. If you modify this Ability with Perks and Flaws, the altered Endurance cost only affects activating the Barrier. Additional Endurance spent to negate Damage remains one for one. [The Perk Effective allows Barrier to be used somewhat offensively. Should anyone try to attack without the Ranged Perk, or otherwise enter the area protected by the Barrier, they will receive Damage. In this case, Barrier is treated like an Attack roll against zero, and damage is calculated accordingly.]"

Although having this extra Endurance is useful, unlike real Endurance, it cannot be spent to receive Drama Dice or for stamina-related tasks. It cannot be regained during combat, nor is it automatically restored between high-tension situations. Endurance for this item can only be regained over a period of time, through rest or recharging over a 24 hour period. Also, Endurance Reserve cannot be used for damage taken in combat. If the character’s normal Health and Endurance is reduced to zero, he or she still falls unconscious, regardless of the amount of Endurance remaining in the item. [Endurance Reserve is often linked to other Abilities through Gear or the Focus Weakness. In these cases, it may be logical for characters to only spend Endurance Reserve to power these Abilities. On the other hand, personal Endurance could represent luck, gumption, and squeezing out just a little bit extra. Whatever you decide, be consistent.]

Only items that are relatively common and of liftable weight can be “pulled” from hammerspace. You could pull a rose, a canvas and easel, or maybe even a gun, but you could not retrieve one of the legendary swords of Masamune, a magic cure for any disease, or a 1985 Chevrolet Camaro (unless you also had sufficient amounts of the Strength Ability to pull it off.) When you wish to pull an item, roll your Hammerspace dice and compare it to the appropriate difficulty. If you succeed, you now have the desired item in your possession. If you fail, you cannot find the object, it won’t work, or you pull a completely different (and usually quite useless) item altogether.

If others safeguard and protect your efforts, you can complete the action in a Round. However, if you make any other rolls, even a Defense roll, the effort is aborted, and you must try again. If a full round passes without intervention, you succeed and the appropriate Health is regained. Characters knocked unconscious can be brought around through restoring their Health above zero. Only so much can be done for any injury in a given day, and an amount of time determined by the Game Master must pass before any single character may be healed again.

Uses of Psychic Ability with a bonus may be done casually and do not require the use of an action in combat or a significant amount of concentration. Psychic abilities without a bonus or penalty require the use of an action and a good deal of concentration. All uses of Psychic with a penalty require undivided attention. Contact (and control) is lost with the target if you are distracted or focus your attention elsewhere. You may make no other actions, even Defense rolls, while performing these powers. In addition to the uses above, you may also talk to others telepathically. This does not require a roll or significant concentration unless the target wants to resist your communication."

VALUES ("Resistance", 
"Your body is especially resilient to a specific kind of damage, such as fire, electricity, or chi, or an attack to a specific area of your body. At Level 1, for every five points of damage you receive, ignore one point. For each successive Level, reduce the damage taken by one. (Level 2 would be four points of damage, ignore one.) Level 5 would be 1 for 1, or essentially rendering you invulnerable to that source. [Before calculating any reduction of Damage from Resistance, always make your Defense roll, if it is possible to make one. This is the case even with other Abilities that replace the Defense roll, such as Barrier.]"

VALUES ("Shape Change", 
"You can change your appearance in various ways, whether through magic or a really great costume and makeup kit. Each Level in this Ability grants ways you can change yourself, but also includes changes possible in each Level below it. At Level 1, you may change your clothes instantaneously. At Level 2, you may alter your age by up to ten years, as well as make slight changes to eye, hair, and skin color. At Level 3, you may change your physical appearance to a moderate extent, and can make drastic changes to eye, hair, and skin color. You can even assume the appearance of the opposite sex, although you remain looking very “girlish” for a boy or “boyish” for a girl. You can also copy the appearance of those who already look somewhat similar to you. At Level 4, you can change your appearance drastically, able to assume the appearance of nearly anyone, as long as they share the same basic biological characteristics – generally, another human. At Level 5, you can assume the appearance of anyone or anything, no matter how bizarre."

"You have a peculiar sense that few have, a kind of feeling that alerts you when you, or someone important to you, is in danger. It may be a true paranormal sense, a voice from beyond, or just a really good gut instinct. You may roll your Sixth Sense dice to notice something “fishy” going on, in addition to attempts to notice ambushes, traps, foul omens, and other unforeseen dangers."

VALUES ("Spirit Medium", 
"You have a deep knowledge of the spirit world and how to interact with it. You can talk with various spirits, as well as summon, banish, and perhaps gain favor from them—with or without extravagant ceremonies. Benign spirits may come and go without much headache, but angry, reclusive, or malevolent spirits will test your skills. When attempting to banish an unwilling spirit, you must roll your Spirit Medium dice against their highest Ability—regardless of what it may be. If you succeed, the spirit is banished to its realm, but if you fail, the spirit may become angry, among other unpleasant things. You may summon a spirit in much the same way. However, even a failed roll may result in the appearance of a given spirit, but the failure will likely result in anger, resentment, or outright violence. Some spirits may even feign servitude to get the upper hand on their would-be masters. [Powerful spirits may require weakening by combat before it is possible to banish them. A trained Spirit Medium will be able to discern when this is the case.]"

VALUES ("Strong", 
"You have a lot of raw physical power at your disposal. You can add your Strong dice when lifting, breaking, climbing, or any other action that tests your natural strength. Strong also acts as a bonus to your Damage Multiplier when fighting bare-handed, striking with weapons, or otherwise attacking with your strength. What follows is a list of suggested difficulties for heavy lifting. The specific examples in parenthesis are written to apply to a typical human, and would not be appropriate for towering mecha and other things of scale. Note also that these Difficulty Numbers imply actually lifting and carrying the object around. If the intention is to just lift the object a few inches off the ground for a short period of time, the difficulty might be a little lower.

After picking up an item, the character may attack with it. The Damage Multiplier will vary from object to object, but a number one-third the DN required to lift it, rounded down, is appropriate. Heavy items are usually good candidates for several perks and flaws, like Awkward, Mighty Blow, or even Ranged, Strength- Powered if a character decides to throw it. Use common sense, and remember it is better to leave a few out than slow down the game detailing a one-time use Attack to the nth degree."

VALUES ("Teleport", 
"Need to get somewhere? In a blink of an eye, you’re there. Of course, you may have more difficulty teleporting long distances. Below is a quick table of Difficulty Numbers for different distances. You must roll your Teleport dice versus this number. If you fail, nothing happens or you end up somewhere other than you intended—possibly ten feet in the air or in another country entirely.
\nTRYING TO TELEPORT... DN \n

You may also use Teleport as a defense in combat. Instead of a normal Defense, roll your Teleport dice. If your roll exceeds that of your opponent’s attack, you teleport far enough away to avoid the blow. If it does not, your teleport fails to achieve the distance necessary or does not happen soon enough. Damage is calculated as if you made a normal Defense roll."

Although no roll is required for small objects, you are required to roll your Telekinesis dice to manipulate heavier objects, much like using the Strong Ability. In fact, the same difficulty table applies. You can also use Telekinesis as an attack, where the Level in the Ability acts as a bonus to your Damage Multiplier."

For each Level in Time Freeze, you gain an equivalent bonus in all tests of speed and quickness—or a penalty to those of your opponents’. While this Ability requires you to perform an action in Combat, you may offset the Multiple Actions penalty by an amount equal to your Level in Time Freeze."

VALUES ("Vehicle(Mecha)", 
"Give your feet a break a while and go cruising in your very own vehicle. This Ability can represent many things, from a motorcycle or sports car to a giant robotic mecha or fighter spacecraft. Your Level in Vehicle may be an abstract representation of its overall usefulness, or it can be used to create a vehicle with speci#ic Abilities. For every Level that you have in Vehicle, you may spend double that number of Levels to “build” it from other Abilities. You may also choose Weaknesses to increase the number of Levels available to craft your machine. Abilities and Weaknesses are not cumulative with your character’s natural advantages and faults. Your vehicle also has a separate Health and Endurance total, which its Damage received and Endurance draining Abilities (should it have any) draw from. The same rules apply to both as normal with the following exception: Health and Endurance are no longer linked. The vehicle is destroyed or effectively incapacitated when Health is depleted, and Endurancedraining Abilities can never draw from Health. Like a normal character, both totals default to 40. Depending on the design of the vehicle, it may be difficult or impossible to attack the pilot without first incapacitating it. Modifiers to strike the pilot (if this is indeed possible at all) are left up to the Game Master’s discretion. [Most characters are assumed to own or have access to vehicles within their own income. Students would have bicycles; working adults, cars; and very rich folk, personal jets. If the vehicle in question is nothing special for the character, then it probably should not be listed as an Ability. On the other hand, a specially modified or upgraded vehicle, or one that is intrinsic to the character’s identity, would be appropriate. Consult with your Game Master if you have a question regarding this.]"

You may now alter its attributes at will as long as its basic description fits in with the kind of item you collect - essentially, draw another gun or get another vehicle from the hangar. You may not retrieve an item of an Ability Level greater than your Walking Arsenal Ability or the focused Ability, nor can you retrieve an item that is substantially different from the theme of your Walking Arsenal. You could not retrieve a sword if you specialize in gun-like weapons…unless, of course, it’s a bayonet…"

Anything. [If the Players and the Game Master prefer it, purchasing—or already owning—items can be treated like any other roll, with Wealthy dice adding to that effort.]"
