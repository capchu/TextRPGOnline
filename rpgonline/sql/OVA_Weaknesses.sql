At Level 2, you have trouble recalling even recent conversations and events, and even when you do remember, the details often elude you. At Level 3, you have the memory of a goldfish, making the world a practical blank past 5 minutes ago.

"You have a most unusual condition, one that causes an inconvenient transformation when you come in contact with a certain substance or experience a certain event. The transformation may wear off once you escape its trigger, find its antidote, or after a length of time determined by the Game Master. At Level 1, you gain one or two Levels of Weaknesses, or are otherwise inconvenienced by this transformation. At Level 2, you gain 3 to 4 Levels of Weaknesses, or are otherwise majorly inconvenienced. At Level 3, you gain 5 Levels or more of Weaknesses, or are otherwise terribly inconvenienced. Even completely losing control of your character is a possibility! In this case, the Game Master controls your character until the transformation has reverted itself. You can always suggest things to the Game Master as a sort of inner voice, but your character may not listen! While it is possible to gain Abilities through this Weakness, your total gained Weaknesses must exceed the gained Abilities by at least as many Levels as described by your Level in Accidental Transformation. [Players who want their characters to become stronger through Accidental Transformation may want to buy appropriate Abilities—or the Transformation Ability itself— and give them a Trigger of whatever causes the Accidental Transformation.]"

"You are easily dismissed by others as useless or a bother because of your apparent age. At Level 1, you appear to be a young teenager or over sixty years of age. You are not completely ignored, but you are often forgotten or unwanted. At Level 2, you look like a child or quite elderly. No one takes you seriously, and you find it hard to gain respect from anyone. At Level 3, you appear to be a very small child or absolutely ancient. Respect is nearly impossible to find, and the thought of having you around is immediately thought of as “babysitting.” [Characters with Abilities and Weaknesses like Position of Power and Infamous may not be appropriate candidates for Ageism. A respected elder of a community or the young heir to the crown are unlikely to deal with the same hardships as others of their age.]"

"Anybody home? The answer to this question is somewhat debatable in your case. You may not be stupid or naive but come off as both through your sheer ability at not understanding, misinterpreting, or otherwise not retaining anything you are told. At Level 1, you sometimes miss the point of a conversation if it gets too long or complicated, and subtle humour completely eludes you. At Level 2, long-winded conversations go over your head completely. You have a hard time following instructions, and only the most overt attempts at wit will successfully be conveyed to you. At Level 3, you have the attention span of a three-year-old, but without the patience to sort building blocks by color. Almost nothing can be successfully discussed with you, and you totally miss the point of anything that’s not a plainly stated fact. Sometimes you won’t even get that."

However, you may still long to know your forgotten beginnings and the cause of your memory-loss. At Level 2, your amnesia is fairly recent. You have had time to readjust to where you are, but much of your life is a blank slate. At Level 3, your amnesia is very recent, and you have almost no memories at all.

At Level 1, you think you are superior to most around you but respect a select few, and those “below” you are treated with at least mild civility. At Level 2, you are above almost everyone, and only a few are worthy “equals.” You often treat those who are unworthy with hostility or a cold pompous attitude. At Level 3, you are the sole reason for the world to be, and you are quite annoyed by the fact others do not see this. You treat everyone, regardless of who they are, as if they were little better than the bubble gum stuck to your shoe.

At Level 1, you sometimes find it hard to use items and be in places meant for the typical human being, but you can still function in society. At Level 2, you cannot use many items meant for normal people. Your size also creates a great hindrance in navigating your surroundings. You may be so large that you can only fit in the very largest of buildings—if you can get in the doorway. Or you may be small enough that you have problems with things being built much higher and larger than you are. Many minor obstacles may become significant challenges. At Level 3, you may be simply huge, and cannot use anything meant for normal sized people, nor can you really function in any normal sized environment without destroying pieces of it regularly, like knocking over trees while walking through a park. On the other hand, you may be positively tiny, unable to get around this “big” world easily at all. Every day items become “mountains” and other insurmountable feats. [Although no other rules are implicit to Awkward Size, Players should consider the possible effects of this trait on other facets of their character. An unusual size may impact the ease in which a character dodges harm or the strength a character possesses, and appropriate Abilities might need to be selected.] [Mecha, giant machines, and monstrous creatures may find the human-sizes examples inappropriate. In such cases, the description should be reinterpreted. A very large space ship with Awkward Size -2 would have difficulty docking in normal hangars, for instance.]"

You may not be hideous, but your appearance may startle those unfamiliar with you or cause immediate distrust. You could never blend in as a “normal” human being. At Level 3, you are a monster.

At Level 3, you have no sense of proper behaviour whatsoever. You do whatever pleases you and say whatever you feel like, regardless of the social repercussions.

At Level 1, you may be a bit butter fingered or accident-prone, but you aren’t absolutely hopeless. You might even be able to move gracefully if you practised enough. At Level 2, things tend to get broken in your presence, and any kind of beautiful or skilled movement is almost entirely outside of your ability.

At Level 2, your code may have many rules, such as the edicts of a major organization, a code of chivalry, or a series of established traditions. On the other hand, your code may be simplistic but highly inhibiting.

You may always want to grab the last piece of sushi or have to make a conscious effort to resist stopping for a few hands when you pass a card game. At Level 2, your problem can adversely affect your life, and you can only resist it with extreme difficulty. You may have an uncontrollable urge to hit on every girl or guy you meet or to gamble your paycheck on a few rolls of the dice. At Level 3, you cannot resist this temptation, and you probably resent anyone even telling you that you have a problem.

You are uneasy around danger and usually the first to jet at the sign of trouble. At Level 1, you can hold your own for a while, but as soon as the tide of any situation turns against you, you are likely to make a convenient exit. At Level 2, you are frightened by danger and try to avoid it whenever possible. You are not above hiding from time to time, and if forced to confront this danger, you will usually run away at the first opportunity. At Level 3, self-preservation is the word, and you avoid any kind of danger, no matter how slight, with all your being. If forced into a sticky situation, you will escape by any means possible. It is not beyond you to divert attention to anyone around to help your flight, even when such actions can cause them serious harm.

At Level 2, you cry often without significant cause. You want the world to be exactly how you wish, and complain at length when it fails to meet those expectations.

At Level 2, you drone on and on and people are compulsively unreceptive. Dates find excuses to leave the table, and audiences may find other diversions and may miss your point.

At Level 3, you barely possess human intelligence. Your language is broken, your ability to read questionable, and attempts to learn or figure out any scholastic task is beyond you.

You may be taken by these diversions of interest, but will quickly refocus on the task at hand. At Level 2, you will not only divert your attention, but you may spend significant time studying the object of distraction.

You may be seen as nagging but never overbearing, and you are only mildly annoyed if things do not meet your standards. At Level 2, you want everything around you to be a certain way and organized to the point of excess.

Which you choose depends largely on the effect you want to achieve. Focus makes it possible to lose Abilities that are core to your being. Gear allows you to compartmentalize several Abilities and even Weaknesses together for easy removal should it suit the situation. Requirement and Weapon provide a reduction in Endurance and also can be applied selectively to certain Attacks without impacting your character’s overall damage output.

At Level 1, you feel the urge often, but your obsession does not monopolize your life. You may even turn down achieving or obtaining your obsession if much bigger things are at stake. At Level 2, the obsession is terribly important to you, and you often push aside other interests to better pursue it. You may even choose it over things that would logically be much more important. It would be a moral crisis to choose between your obsession and a friend, or maybe even your own life. At Level 3, your obsession is your sole reason for existence. Nothing is comparable, and nothing can stand in your way. You may even choose your obsession over things incredibly important to you, like friends and family, or your continued personal well-being."

VALUES ("Overconfident", 
"Although a good helping of self-confidence can be a good thing, you went back for seconds. You have a bloated sense of what you can accomplish and your abilities in general. At Level 1, you still have a (relatively) level head, but you overstate your abilities enough to get into situations you truly are not well equipped for. You don’t like to give up, but you will eventually figure out when you are outmatched. At Level 2, only the largest obstacles are considered too big for you to take on. You often jump into situations way out of your league and find it hard to reconsider your course of action, even when it is apparent you cannot handle it. At Level 3, you think you can take on the world…with one arm tied behind your back. You will never concede that any situation is too tough for you to handle, and will be hard-pressed to ever give up, whatever the circumstances may be."

VALUES ("Outcast", 
"You do not belong here, and there are those eager to help you understand this. You may have been ostracised due to your actions or affiliations, or perhaps you were simply born into it. Whatever the reason, there are those who would rather you be somewhere else…or not “be” at all. At Level 1, you are discriminated against by a small group, such as a club or clique of friends in high school. This group may be hostile towards you, and you cannot participate in their activities. At Level 2, you are an outsider to a large group, such as a major faction, class, or otherwise substantial body of people. Avoiding run-ins with them is problematic for you. At Level 3, your presence is largely questioned by almost everyone around you. Discrimination, distaste, and even outright violence is a daily part of your life."

VALUES ("Pacifist", 
"A deep part of you does not believe in the necessity of violence, and you try to avoid it whenever possible. At Level 1, you try to avoid confrontations, but will fight if it really is the most logical option. At Level 2, you will never attack anyone except in self-defence, to keep someone you care about from coming to great harm, or when your very life is on the line. At Level 3, you will never raise a hand to anyone, no matter what happens."

VALUES ("Poor", 
"Some people have all the money they could ever want, and there are others who have to fight tooth and nail to make ends meet. Unfortunately, you are of the latter. At Level 1, you live in cramped, unspectacular conditions and rarely have money to spend on anything beyond your basic needs. At Level 2, you live in a run-down shack or other dwelling barely passable as a residence. You have no money and have to maintain multiple jobs to make ends meet. At Level 3, you are dead broke and homeless. Even the most basic of purchases are beyond your reach."

INSERT INTO weaknesses (name, description) 
VALUES ("Quirk", 
"You have a curious habit or tic that may affect how others think about you. At Level 1, the habit is odd but more likely to be thought of as eccentric than offensive. You may carry around a stuffed animal wherever you go, sing and rhyme constantly, or speak in an old-fashioned language. At Level 2, your idiosyncrasy may offend some people, but would be unlikely to incur violence or hatred. You may swear like a sailor, have no regard for people’s personal space, or think of personal hygiene as a suggestion instead of a necessity. At Level 3, the habit is terribly offensive, and may cause outright hatred in others—even violence. You may kick puppies for sport, wear accessories made from the bones of your enemies, or openly kill animals to provide you with bloody, on-the-spot meals."

VALUES ("Restricted Freedom", 
"Because of your job, your birth, or some other reason, you are limited in your capacity to do what you want to do, when you want to do it. At Level 1, you are only mildly inconvenienced. You may have a job that requires you to put in for vacation time and other leaves, or you may have very protective parents that make it difficult to do things without explicit permission. At Level 2, much of your life is dictated by your circumstances. You may have a job that requires you to report in daily and get approval for future activities, or perhaps you are part of a powerful family that keeps you close by and well-guarded. At Level 3, every moment of your life is carefully penciled in. Your job may have complete control over your actions, or you might be royalty, with every moment scheduled and your every move watched over by a plethora of guards."

"There is someone you feel the need to best—or they feel the need to best you. More than likely, it’s both. This rivalry could encompass anything: a simple contest of skills, a competition for someone’s affections, or even deadly duels! At Level 1, your rival is less skilful than you or has a significant disadvantage. At Level 2, your competition is just as capable as you are, or the playing field is otherwise equal. At Level 3, your rival possesses skills well beyond your own or otherwise has a significant advantage."

"They say two’s company, but you might disagree. Due to some bizarre happening or mishap, you have another voice in your head that isn’t yours. Perhaps it is a mischievous spirit, a cybernetic implant with artificial intelligence, or maybe you’re just plain crazy. At Level 1, this voice is supportive, maybe sometimes helpful. However, you will probably be cajoled into a conversation with it, which will attract its fair share of perplexed looks. At Level 2, the voice isn’t particularly helpful but is not exactly a hindrance either. The voice may be rude and sarcastic, but eschews attacking you personally…unless you really botch something up. At Level 3, the voice is harmful to your well-being, whether by being constantly abusive or coaxing you into performing wrong or evil acts. The voice may be extremely persuasive, and you might do things you will later regret."

"There is something about yourself that you wish to keep secret. You could be a crime fighter by night, hiding your identity in order to keep friends and family from harm. On the other hand, you may have a dark past that would destroy your life as you know it if revealed. At Level 1, you protect your secret, but should it be discovered, there are few serious consequences. These might involve mild embarrassment, an unwanted celebrity status, or other inconvenient social complications. At Level 2, you conceal your secret passionately. Should it be revealed, the secret would cause severe problems, such as the endangerment of yourself and others, the loss of your livelihood, or perhaps even incarceration. At Level 3, your secret must be kept at all costs. Your feeling of this may be so strong that you would choose death over its discovery. You feel the revelation of your secret would completely wreck your life."

"Everyone gets at least a little annoyed when they’re teased, but you take it to an entirely new level. You have a particular sore spot, be it your hair, wealth, muscle tone, chest size, or lack of any of the above, that you are incredibly sensitive about. At Level 1, any insults or jeers to your sensitive area will immediately cause you to be very angry and hostile to the offender. At Level 2, such actions will not only be met with hostility, but you will make all attempts possible to get back at the offender, physically or otherwise, as soon as possible. At Level 3, you will hold a grudge against any offenders until the day you die, or failing that, hate their guts until something happens to change your mind. Oh, and you will probably attempt to cause serious harm to this person at every available opportunity, too."

VALUES ("Servitude", 
"You are in the service of a person or organization. As might be expected, you are required to perform any tasks and take any orders placed upon you. This may be the nature of your occupation, the result of a gambling debt, or even a self-imposed service to someone you admire or care about. At Level 1, your servitude is mostly voluntary, and although you feel obligated to perform your duties, you can weasel out of them when need be. At Level 2, you are devoted to your service and do your work as best as you can. You may sacrifice your duties if something very important to you comes up, but you may have to face repercussions for “falling out of line” or feel strong pangs of guilt. At Level 3, your servitude is your life, and little, if anything, comes between you and your duties. You comply with your tasks and orders without question, and not doing so could result in terrible consequences, or you may never forgive yourself for your disobedience."

VALUES ("Short Temper", 
"If you were dynamite, you would have a frighteningly short fuse. It doesn’t take much to get you angry, and you may lash out even when nothing has really been done to you. At Level 1, you tend to be irritable and easily annoyed. You may grumble and yell at others, but you rarely get downright angry unless you are justifiably ticked off. At Level 2, you are prone to anger, and it takes little provocation to set you off. You may even resort to violence, if anyone is dumb enough to keep antagonizing you. At Level 3, you are angered by the slightest discretion against you, even if they were accidents. You may even view things that were not negative to you at all as if they were, and you react accordingly with loud tantrums and brutal attacks."

VALUES ("Shy", 
"You are uncomfortable dealing with other people. You are slow to make friends, and generally make few of them. You are also easily embarrassed and find it difficult to act in public. At Level 1, you are a bit reclusive, preferring the company of a select few friends. Though not exactly anti-social, you tend to be quiet to those outside of your circle. At Level 2, you have a reputation for being shy. You are probably a social misfit or a reclusive bookworm, more comfortable in your own company than that of others. You only attend parties or other social gatherings if forced, and only have one or two close friends. At Level 3, social interactions are the worst of tortures for you. You avoid contact whenever possible, just barely interacting enough to get by with your life."

"Swift you are not, and your overall quickness is underwhelming. You tend to react to things after they have happened, and the Turtle could take naps in a race with you.

"There is something in this world that you cannot help but enjoy far too much. This could be anything: a good steak, motorcycles, liquor, or even stuffed animals. At Level 1, you may be influenced by your Soft Spot, but you won’t intentionally put yourself into harm’s way for it. At Level 2, you are heavily influenced by your Soft Spot, and may be bribed into poor decisions or coaxed into dangerous situations with it. At Level 3, you cannot resist your Soft Spot, making it horribly easy to take advantage of you. You will ignore obvious dangers and put yourself at risk before allowing it to go to waste, escape your possession, or otherwise come to harm in any way."

VALUES ("Split Personality", 
"They say two heads are better than one. Unfortunately for you, the old axiom fails to mention anything about two minds. Or three, or four… or ten. Through illness, a traumatizing incident, or some other means, you have developed one or more distinct personality besides your own. You may switch personalities when stressed or confronted by some other trigger. At Level 1, you have another personality, but it is not a particularly harmful one, nor is it drastically different from your own. Maybe you become a bit bolder, or your typical seriousness fades into unusual good humour. While you may do things you never would have, the repercussions are minor. At Level 2, you have another personality that is distinctly different from your own. You may take on a Don Juan persona where you once were shy and reclusive or become cowardly when you once were brave and commanding. Others will clearly see something is amiss, but you are unlikely to do much to cause any long-lasting problems in your life. At Level 3, however, your other self is particularly dangerous, maybe even evil. You may turn on friends, become deceitful, or do other particularly nasty things. You unfortunately have no control of this persona, so you must take the consequences in full whenever you revert to your normal self."

"You’re not an unreasonable person – at least, not until anyone disagrees with you. You hold steadfast to your ideals and take offense to anyone trying to convince you that these ideals, or your actions based on them, are wrong. At Level 1, you are not beyond the realm of reason. If someone can provide a sufficient argument, you may be willing to back down or modify your train of thought. With Level 2, you are very stubborn, and will keep to your mindset unless provided with an incredibly blunt and forceful reason to change your mind. However, at Level 3, almost nothing will change your mind. If you believe something, you will likely believe it to the day you die, even if your stubbornness will cause harm to yourself and others."

At Level 1, you may be seen as accident-prone, and though you do get hurt occasionally, it’s never too serious. While at Level 2, you get hurt often enough that it is exceptional. You are often used as a guinea pig, trap-tester, human shield, or other potentially dangerous occupation without your consent.

At Level 2, the hunter wants to give you a little payback for something, take something from you, or is very capable of getting what they want. At Level 3, the hunter wants you severely punished, possibly even killed, or wants to take something of incredible significance to you and will do anything, even kill you, to get it.
