Idea: Online Text RPG Tools
Details: This is a startup idea / tools to help make text RPGs more popular. Text RPGs are basically the forefathers of modern videogames (many even use systems from old text based RPGs). Many people still enjoy playing them but itâ€™s hard to find people locally to play with. The goal is to make a set of tools that will allow people to play a text based RPG over the internet. The idea is to make it so anyone with a little coding experience could modify the server to host their favorite text RPGs so they can play with their friends or family who no longer live nearby. So far the best free thing I have found for this purpose is to use an image editor to fill out a character sheet (which is a pain) and share all the images over google docs with those who are in the game so these tools will help a lot.
 
Features (Implementing)
-Character sheet creation (using a form)
-Saving a character sheet to a database
-Generating an image of the character sheet using the actual creation sheet graphic
-A "game room" part of the client where images representing the characters are displayed.
-Clicking on those images allows you to view the character's sheet graphic
-A modification page where you can make changes to a character
-Client side will be via a web browser

Features (If brought further)
-Friends list and friend finder
-Capabilities for more than one RPG
-A way to represent a game board (some RPGs use them, but not the one we are implementing)
-User edit privileges (the "GM" can edit any character in the game, but players can only edit their own)
-Concurrent Updating for the game board
-Dynamic image sizes for icons and character pictures
-A voice chat system so you don't have to use an outside program
-A text chat system for inside of the game

Back End: A server that can take the data given and create an image of the filled out form to be hosted. The image will then be sent to the person who requests it during a game, or the data given if they desire to edit it.

Front End: A web page where you can create character sheets by filling out the given online form. You can also host a game and tell it what characters are involved (adding them to the game). This will allow those players who are in the game to view all characters involved.
 
Framework: Python (SQLAlchemy and Flask), MySQL, HTML, CSS, (Maybe some AJAX and PHP)
